# Reflection

Make all your changes in `Main.java`.  There are instructions in TODO
comments there.

**NOTE** you will likely not be able to run this homework using an IDE. Because Java code is usually not distributed 
as `.class` files like this, the IDE will complain that the `Cat` class cannot be found.  You should try to run 
your program using the command line

```sh
javac *.java
java Main
```
