# Text Summarization

This project is broken up into four class files that correspond to the four parts of the assignment.
Each file contains various hints and bits of code to get you started.  There is also a modified
version of the BagOfWords class from assignment 5.3.  You will need to edit this to include your
solution from 5.3 and also implement one method described in the Part 2 hints.

Each part file can be tested independently, for example:
```
javac *.java
java Part1
```

To test all four parts, 
```
javac *.java
java Test
```
